I am a French developer mainly working on web backend technologies. I'm more of Jack of all trades, I like to learn new
things and hop on fresh interests.
I am a huge fan of technology in general, music and video games.

Here I mainly talk about what I learn, what I want to learn, what I just bought and basically anything that comes to my
mind.

If you're more interested in the technical side of things, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/RangoDisco)

The source code for this blog is also available [here](https://github.com/RangoDisco/blog)

## The blog itself

This blog is made using [Astro](https://astro.build/), and the [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)
theme.
So that means:

- Typescript/Javascript
- TailwindCSS
- React
- And of course, Markdown

Feel free to ask me anything of give me feedback via my [email](mailto:rango@posteo.net).
